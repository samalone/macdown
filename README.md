MacDown is an open source Markdown editor for OS X, released under the MIT License. The author stole the idea from [Chen Luo](https://twitter.com/chenluois)’s [Mou](http://mouapp.com) so that people can make crappy clones.

Visit the [project site](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for more information, or download [MacDown.app.zip](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/download/latest/) directly from the [latest releases](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/releases/latest) page.

## Development

### Requirements

If you wish to build MacDown yourself, you will need the following components/tools:

* macOS 12.0 or later
* Xcode (latest stable; the project builds on Xcode 26+)
* Git

> Note: The Command Line Tools (CLT) should be unnecessary. If you failed to compile without it, please install CLT with
>
>     xcode-select --install
>
> and report back.

MacDown no longer uses CocoaPods. Every dependency is a Swift Package — local
packages under `Packages/` or remote packages that Xcode resolves automatically
from the committed `Package.resolved`.

### Environment Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (directory containing this `README.md` file):

    git submodule update --init
    make -C Dependency/peg-markdown-highlight

and open `MacDown.xcodeproj` in Xcode. The first command initialises the
dependency submodule(s) used in MacDown (the Prism syntax highlighter); the
second builds the bundled PEG highlighter. Xcode resolves the Swift Packages on
first open.

If you run into build issues later on, try updating the submodule and letting
Xcode re-resolve packages (File ▸ Packages ▸ Resolve Package Versions):

    git submodule update

## Discussion

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/MacDownApp/macdown)

Join our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/MacDownApp/macdown) if you have any problems with MacDown. Any suggestions are welcomed, too!

You can also [file an issue directly](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/issues/new) on GitHub if you prefer so. But please, **search first to make sure no-one has reported the same issue already** before opening one yourself. MacDown does not update in your computer immediately when we make changes, so something you experienced might be known, or even fixed in the development version.

MacDown depends a lot on other open source projects, such as [Hoedown](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown) for Markdown-to-HTML rendering, [Prism](http://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting (in code blocks), and [PEG Markdown Highlight](https://github.com/ali-rantakari/peg-markdown-highlight) for editor highlighting. If you find problems when using those particular features, you can also consider reporting them directly to upstream projects as well as to MacDown’s issue tracker. I will do what I can if you report it here, but sometimes it can be more beneficial to interact with them directly.

## Tipping

If you find MacDown suitable for your needs, please consider [giving me a tip through PayPal](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/faq/#donation). Or, if you prefer to buy me a drink *personally* instead, just [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/uranusjr) when you visit [Taipei, Taiwan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei), where I live. I look forward to meeting you!
